# ikusei

Ikusei is a multi-use Discord bot aimed to provide
easy use to moderation and have multiple fun
commands built into the project.

-----

Currently, it has commands such as:
* ik.help - Shows the list of commands available
* ik.meme - Grabs a random meme off r/dankmemes
* ik.echo - Repeats the message provided to the bot
* ik.stats - Provides statistics about the bot
* ik.prefix - Change the prefix of the bot to a
different prefix, if you'd like
* ik.kick - Kicks the provided member
* ik.ban - Bans the provided member
* ik.unban - Unbans the provided member's ID
* ik.purge - Clears the provided amount of messages
prior to the command call (Default = 5)

-----

Plans for the future:
* A sleek and clean experience and profile system
* Auto & Reaction Roles
* Starboard
* More moderation tools such as nuking, warnings
and a "support ticket" feature so your members 
can ask you for support about your server
* Search system for Spotify, definitions and
anime
* Utilities such as reminders, color generator 
and profile picture grabbing
* More fun commands like 8ball, fortune telling
and Rock/Paper/Scissors
